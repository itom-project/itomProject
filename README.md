# itom project #

welcome to the open source software **itom**. It allows operating measurement systems with multiple hardware components, like cameras, AD-converters, actuators, motor stages as well as handling your lab automation. The graphical user interface provides a quick and easy access to all components, complex measurement tasks and algorithms can be scripted using the embedded python scripting language and self-defined user interfaces finally provide a possibility to adapt **itom** to your special needs. External hardware or algorithms are added to **itom** by an integrated plugin system.
